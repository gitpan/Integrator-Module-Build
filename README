Integrator-Module-Build

This module is used to design test harnesses compatible with Integrator
from Cydone Solutions. There is a comprehensive help document on how to
use this module that is embeded in ./lib/Integrator/Module/Build.pm. You
can also go to http://www.cydone.com and click on the demo icon to
register to a free demo.

After installation 'man Integrator::Module::Build' should get you started.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands (as root):

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Note: Integrator::Module::Build needs access to xml and ssl tools.  We have
found that the installation process can be streamlined a lot if specific
software packages are already installed before attempting to start the
Integrator::Module::Build installation itself.

You will find three scripts to help you install these software
packages before attempting to install the perl modules required by
Integrator::Module::Build in the following sections.

UBUNTU and DEBIAN MACHINE DEPENDANCIES

The 'pre_config_ubuntu' and 'pre_config_debian' scripts should be all that
is necessary to pre configure the installation by installing software
packages. Simply run one of the selected script before installing the
module. Any of these scripts will typically install software packages
with a one-liner:

> apt-get install gcc build-essential libxml-perl libexpat1-dev libssl-dev

(see the script for the exact list)

FEDORA MACHINE DEPENDANCIES

The 'pre_config_fedora' script should be all that is necessary to pre
configure the installation by installing required software packages. Run
this script before installing the module. It typically installs packages
with a one-liner:

> yum -y install gcc perl-libxml-perl expat-devel openssl openssl-devel

(see the script for the exact list)

WINDOWS MACHINE DEPENDANCIES

(coming soon...)
